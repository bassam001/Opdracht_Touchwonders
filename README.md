# Opdracht_Touchwonders
Assignment
Overview
Create a simple app that shows the list of public "source" repositories in the Touchwonders GitHub
account (https://github.com/orgs/Touchwonders/repositories filter by "Sources").
You can use `https://api.github.com/orgs/Touchwonders/repos` as an endpoint.
User stories
1) The list should be ordered by 'number of stars'.
2) Tapping an item in the list should navigate the user to a new page with information about the
repository (at least: name, description, stars, watchers count, forks, open issues).
3) Optional: the list can be reordered by the user by changing some settings.
4) Optional: tapping the number of stars triggers an animation: a star appears at the top of the screen
and "falls" to the bottom of the screen.
5) Optional: add unit testing and UI testing.
Visual
Colors, themes, icons, fonts and other UI choices are not specified. You have full creative
freedom.
Technical requirements
You must use React Native to create the app.
You can use existing libraries. You should be able to provide a reason why you chose to use a
library (or not to use a library).
Output
Either a zip file or a hosted repository with the code.
The project should build and run without any extra configuration.
Notes
- The project should take no more than 3-4 hours to finish. You can address the optional points if
you finish within the time, or if you just want to challenge yourself.
- Documentation in the code is part of the assignment.
- Our evaluation criteria include looking for code that is clean, readable, and maintainable.
